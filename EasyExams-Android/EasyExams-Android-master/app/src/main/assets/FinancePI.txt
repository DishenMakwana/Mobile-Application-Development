Describe the scope of costs in managerial accounting
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Direct cost is a price that can be completely attributed to the production of specific goods or services.

Sunk cost refers to cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs (also known as retrospective costs) are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. Differential cost is the difference between the cost of two alternative decisions, or of a change in output levels. The concept is used when there are multiple possible options to pursue, and a choice must be made to select one option and drop the others.

The marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. When marginal benefit>marginal cost, you should go through with the decision.

Sometimes avoiding a risk is practical, other times it is not. You cannot avoid all risks, but you can reduce their likelihood in many cases by taking preventative measures. This is risk reduction. Sometimes you need to take on responsibility for a risk, such as when you know the possible loss will be small. This is called risk assumption, and it may mean not buying insurance for something or self-insuring it.

--TERM_DEFINITION--
The value of money changes over time due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and domestic business cycles.

Picture this scenario:
Given a CPI of 10%, a bank offers you three options:
a) Receive $100 now
b) Receive $109 in a year
c) Receive $120 in two years

Which choice yields the greatest return?
A. In one year, $100 is worth $110, and in two years, it is worth $121, trumping both of the other choices by a dollar.

the longer you invest money, the more likely it will earn more money which increases the value of your money. this means, when possible you need to invest as soon as possible. you also want to invest as much money as possible for longer. more money, more time equals better returns (money earned on investments)

When you buy stock, you are buying shares of the company. You can buy any number of shares. Medium to high risk investment: easy to low money.
Bonds are simply loans to business, local state or federal governments. The individual will be paid back the amount they paid for the bond plus interest at the maturity date (end of the life of the bond). Medium to low risk investment.
Mutual funds are a group of stock and/or bonds that put together by a fund manager. Large numbers of consumers invest in the same mutual fund. This allows all of their money to pool together allowing them to buy more of everything and better investments. Medium to low risk investments.

You pay $500 a year to have medical insurance. If you don't have any accidents, you didn't get anything from the insurance but it reduced your financial risk because if something happens to you and you need medical assistane, that assistance will cost quite a bit of money. But because you paid the $500, the insurance company will pay the hospital bills which will likely be quite a bit more money than what you paid.
The insurance company can afford this because they get a whole bunch of people to pay into the insurance "pool" of money.
