Explain the principles of supply and demand.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
In a market-oriented economy like in the United States, supply and demand determine the prices and quantities of goods and services produced. Supply is the amount of goods and services producers are willing to make and sell. Demand is the willingness and ability of consumers to buy goods and services. Supply and demand interact in the marketplace resulting in a state of equilibrium, surplus, or shortage.

The law of supply states that price and quantity supplied move in the same direction (a direct relationship). Thus, as price increases, the amount of goods and services supplied increases. Conversely, the law of demand states that as price increases, the amount desired by consumers will decrease (an inverse relationship). When the amount of a product/service being supplied equals the amount being demanded, equilibrium exists in the marketplace at that price. If, however, there is more supply than demand for a product a surplus exists, potentially leading to lower prices. A shortage exists when demand exceeds supply, a condition that can lead to rising prices.

Price competition assumes that, with all other considerations being equal, a customer will buy the lowest-priced product. Nonprice competition is where businesses compete on factors such as product quality, business location and reputation, customer service, and payment or financing options available.

Conversely, constructive criticism is designed to be helpful. It is said calmly with a focus on the problem, not the person, and suggestions for improvements are given. Anyone who is new to a job must expect criticism.

One can control his/her reaction to feedback. Maintain a positive attitude and try to avoid getting defensive. People who respond to negative feedback in a positive way generally impress others. Those who work on correcting their weaknesses tend to move ahead in their careers. When giving feedback, it is important that your message be clear and easily understood. Give feedback in a nonthreatening manner, discussing problems with others one-on-one when possible.

Describe the concept of price stability as an economic measure.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Price stability is a factor that can enable economic growth. When prices are stable, investors and businesses know what to expect in the marketplace and in government. Businesses can make long-term plans knowing that market conditions will not change drastically and that the government will not run out of money. Globally, investors are more likely to put their money into countries with price stability, leaving behind nations that could use those investments for economic expansion.

Explain the nature of stress management.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Stress is a person's reaction to pressures from the outside world. It can be mental or physical. Managing stress is important to a healthy lifestyle and effectiveness in the workplace. Stress can be harmful, causing undue anxiety and suppressing the body's immune system.

Three things are essential to help prevent or reduce stress: regular exercise, a balanced diet, and enough sleep. Researchers emphasize engaging in recreational activities as a way to manage stress. In times of stress, it is important to make reasonable compromises and learn to accept those things you cannot change about the world around you.

Discuss the measure of consumer spending as an economic indicator.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Consumer spending is also called consumption, and it includes all spending by households on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Consumer spending is one variable used to calculate Gross Domestic Product, along with investment, government spending, and net exports. The amount of money actually available for consumer spending is called disposable personal income. Consumer spending, then, is one measure of the overall health of an economy.
--ROW--
Explain the use of diaries.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
A market researcher can collect specific information through a research participant diary that is kept over a period of time. A diary may be open-question or forced choice, depending on the time allowed for the market research study.

How can you show empathy for others?
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Empathy is an understanding of another person's situation or frame of mind. On the job, you should be open-minded, realizing that many people are under pressure. Treat others considerately, and call on your own experiences. Before you react to someone, think of the position the other person is in. You may see things differently, and your reaction may be more effective. Be aware of how you appear to someone else, trying not to hurt or offend them. Speak carefully, and think about the way others will feel when they hear what you have to say. Let other people know you are interested in them, smile, and make them feel important. Do not assume that certain behaviors and views are universal; many people in the world have ideas that are very different from yours.
--ROW--
Explain the concept of Gross Domestic Product.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located within a country. GDP is one measure of a nation's productivity, or the output of workers in a given period of time. GDP is made up of several elements: private investment, government spending, personal spending, net exports of goods, and change in business inventories. Two types of GDP are nominal GDP and real GDP. Nominal GDP is stated in the price levels in which the GDP was measured; real GDP is the nominal GDP adjusted for changes in prices.

Calculate GDP as follows: add private business spending, government spending, and personal spending. Then either add a trade surplus or subtract a trade deficit, and either add expanding inventories or subtract shrinking inventories. A similar measure to GDP is Gross National Product. GNP is the total dollar value of goods and services produced by a nation, including those produced outside of its own territory by its own citizens.
--ROW--
Discuss the impact of a nation's unemployment rates.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
There are three main impacts of lingering unemployment on an economy: efficiency, inequality, and discouraged workers. Unemployment is inefficient in that it wastes human resources. It leads to inequality because those with the least experience tend to lose their jobs first, which are usually minorities and the young. Lastly, unemployed people tend to get discouraged about themselves and their abilities, and may give up their search for work.

Unemployment is an important indicator of the overall strength of an economy. The higher the unemployment rate, the greater the chances of an economic slowdown. Likewise, the lower the unemployment rate, the greater the chances of an economic recovery. When more people are working, more people are spending money and paying taxes to help the economy grow.
--ROW--
Describe the economic impact of inflation on business.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Inflation refers to rising prices; it is an indicator of the stability of an economy. A low level of inflation (between 1 and 5 percent per year) is considered good because it indicates a stable economy. Higher levels of inflation are harmful to businesses. Rising prices cause consumers to spend less, slowing the overall economy. Inflation also leads to higher wages. A high level of inflation may cause wages to increase beyond what businesses can afford to pay, which can lead to layoffs and downsizing. Interest rates rise in periods of inflation. Rising interest rates mean that borrowing money becomes more expensive. Businesses are, thus, less likely to borrow money to expand their operations. With inflation, the value of a dollar decreases so businesses and individuals cannot buy as much with the same dollar as they could before.

Inflation can be helpful to individuals and businesses who are borrowers. Those who borrow at a fixed rate of interest can repay the debt with dollars that are worth less, which makes their repayments smaller than they would have been without inflation.
--ROW--

--TERM_DEFINITION--
An insurance policy is a contract between a business or individual and an insurance company to cover risks. Business risks include economic risks, natural risks, and human risks. Insurance companies estimate the probability of loss due to risk and determine a rate to charge for the policy, called a premium.

Property insurance is one common type of insurance, which covers loss or damage to buildings and equipment. Property insurance can be purchased to cover full replacement cost, automatic increase protection, and business interruption. Liability insurance is a form of insurance that protects against damages for which a business or individual may be liable, including injury or property damage to others.
--ROW--
Determine the impact of business cycles on business activities.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
A business cycle is a series of recurring changes in economic activity. Four phases make up a business cycle: expansion, recession, trough, and recovery. During expansion, the economy is flourishing. It is a good time for businesses to start up or expand due to the increased output of goods and services. Recession is a time of economic slowdown lasting at least two quarters. Companies reduce their output during a recession, and consumers have less money to spend on goods and services. A prolonged recession is called a depression.

A trough is the low point in a business cycle. It marks the beginning of the transition from recession/depression to recovery when signs of economic growth are near. In the recovery phase, demand increases and businesses respond by hiring more workers and supplying more goods.

A number of factors affect the business environment, therefore it is important to research the industry and understand the surrounding economy. Industry trends and patterns of change in areas such as sales growth and government regulation should be considered.
Understanding the competition will help you plan a strategy of success. Barriers to entry in an industry may exist, such as a dominant competitor, economies of scale, and

customer brand loyalty. Other industry factors include threats from substitute products, supply sources, and technology.

A critical area to analyze is the demographics of your business environment, including number of companies, annual revenues, and average number of workers employed.
Assessing the competition includes looking at market share and analyzing the position of your company relative to others in the marketplace.

Explain the concept of ethical work habits.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Ethics are the basic values and moral principles that guide behavior. Characteristics of ethical work habits include honesty, respect, and equity. Being honest is more than just telling the truth. It means maintaining confidentiality and having respect for company property. Honesty is the basis for a trustworthy business relationship. Another solid base for business/customer relations is showing respect. This means listening to others with an open mind and responding with courtesy and tact. Equity means that everyone has equal rights and opportunities. Because people expect to be treated the way those around them are treated, it is important to be fair and equitable in dealing with others.
--ROW--
Explain the nature of effective communications.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Communication is the process of exchanging messages between a sender and a receiver. Effective communicators need to understand channels of communication and media, effective listening skills, barriers to communication, and non-verbal cues. In addition, one must be prepared to read for meaning, speak properly, and write effectively.

Channels (or media) are the avenues through which a message can be delivered. The choice of medium depends on the nature and importance of the message. Effective listening allows a person to identify the purpose of the speaker, give feedback, and evaluate the speaker's message. Communication may be impeded by a number of barriers, including physical such as distance and position from the speaker, and verbal as in using vague or unclear language. Lastly, a person's non-verbal cues—such as his or her tone of voice, emphasis, and body language—are critical because they often communicate as much as the speaker's actual words.
--ROW--
Evaluate questionnaire design.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
A market research questionnaire should provide data that is valid and reliable. Questions should measure what is intended in the market research problem and be clear, properly written, formatted and conducted.

Explain the impact of political relationships within an organization.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
A company's culture affects the way it is organized. A formal culture may include a strict chain of command, with one person at the top making all decisions. Several levels of management, or bureaucracy, may follow. Job titles are important as indicators of power and status within a company in a business with a formal culture. Making changes and passing down decisions in such an organization can be complicated and time consuming.

Other companies have an informal culture, where employees are encouraged to make their own decisions. In such a company, job titles are not as important as creativity and teamwork.
--ROW--

Explain how to utilize negotiation skills in business.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Negotiation is the process of working with or among the parties in a conflict to find a resolution, and requires a willingness to work together to achieve a mutually-agreeable solution. No company will completely avoid conflict in the workplace, so learning and practicing negotiation skills is important. Six effective techniques for negotiating conflict are:
1) show respect
2) recognize and define the problem
3) seek a variety of possible solutions
4) collaborate, or work together
5) be reliable
6) preserve your relationship
The two most important negotiation skills are speaking and listening.

Each party must first present the problem from their point of view. Use a non-aggressive tone and "I statements" to make your point, trying not to cast blame. Active listening on your part shows you are interested in the other person's ideas and feelings. Try to empathize with the person who is speaking. The problem is solved only when both/all parties reach a common agreement.

--ROW--
Explain the concept of market and market identification.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
The market is the group of customers a company is most likely to try to sell to. The total market would be all of the potential customers the
company could reach. This total market would be divided into several smaller groups (market segmentation) based on demographic factors
like income, occupation, age, etc. and psychographic factors like attitudes, pet ownership, and lifestyles and geographic factors such as
where the customer’s homes are. The company would then study each segment to determine which group or groups they would like to focus
their efforts on selling to (target market). These decisions will be based on how easy it will be to reach or satisfy certain customers or how
easy it will be to make sales to them.

Explain the concept of accounting.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Financial information for a business can be recorded, summarized, and reported in a variety of ways. The way in which information is kept and reported is determined by the size, type, and complexity of a business. Businesses should also consider the types of decisions that will be made when designing an accounting system. Types of information to be gathered include purchases, sales, expenses, and payroll. There are two basic types of accounting methods: cash and accrual. In the cash accounting method, income and expenses are recorded at the time the money changes hands. The accrual method of accounting records transactions at the time they occur even if no money changes hands at that time.

Accounting records show changes and the current account balance of each asset, liability, and owners' equity account. The recording of debit and credit parts of a transaction is called double-entry accounting. A record summarizing the information relevant to a single item in the accounting equation is called an account. With every action, at least two accounts will change. A group of accounts is called a ledger. A form for recording transactions is called a journal.

Explain types of investments.
--TERM_DEFINITION--
There are several main types of investment vehicles. Common stock is a unit of ownership of a company that entities the owner to voting privileges. Preferred stock is a type of stock that gives the owner the advantage of receiving cash dividends before common stockholders receive them. Stocks are attractive as an investment because owners share in the success of the company. A corporate bond is a corporation's written pledge to repay a specific amount of money, plus interest. Similarly, a government bond is the written pledge of a government or municipality to repay a specific amount of money, plus interest. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to a corporation or government entity for a period of time.

Mutual funds are investments in which investors pool their money to buy stock, bonds, and/or other securities. The investments are selected by professional managers who work for an investment company. Their expertise can be beneficial to inexperienced investors. A final form of investment is to own real estate. The goal of this is to own property that increases in value so you can sell it at a profit or receive rental income.
