Make decisions
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Students may select any of the choices available. Ensure that students explain WHY they have selected the given alternative Making a good informed decision is not that different to sitting on a jury – all reasonable doubt has to be removed before you can pass a verdict one way or the other. Thankfully, though, corporate decisions are seldom a matter of life or death!

Don’t judge a book by its cover - You may be someone who’s big on first impressions when you meet people but you can’t let the same thought process influence your decision-making. If on first hearing an idea strikes you as a really good one, you may well be correct, but you mustn’t allow that first reaction to influence your ability to objectively weigh the cons as well as all the pros when they are presented.

Do your homework - Just because no significant cons are presented it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, so get someone on to digging them up and evaluating them while you still have the time – discovering them after you’ve launched the deal doesn’t do you any favours. Insisting that this homework is conducted becomes doubly important if and when everyone is unanimously in favour of going ahead with the project. Nothing is perfect, so work hard at uncovering whatever hidden warts the thing might have and by removing them you’ll only make it better
Still.

Avoid making decisions in isolation - Every decision has some degree of impact on your ability to adopt other future opportunities in what the experts call ‘the decision stream’. This one may be a ‘too good to miss’ opportunity but how will it affect other projects or priorities and, if now is not the best time to do it, what risks if any are there in putting the thing on hold for an agreed period of time? If you cannot manage this project in addition to another that’s waiting in the wings, which one gets the nod and why?

Do everything you can to protect the downside - All wise investors go to great lengths to do this with their stock portfolios and when setting up a new business you should try to employ the same strategies.

Give it time - If you have the time to use the ‘orchestrated procrastination’ approach then do so. Without getting into the ‘paralysis by analysis’ mode, doing more rather than less homework on a project is seldom a bad thing. While looking at it more deeply you may find better
alternatives or the marketplace may change.
Making smart informed decisions is why leaders get paid the big bucks. There is really no science to getting it right every time which is why (unfortunately) decision-making is not a process that can be programmed to come in ‘just in time’ across the board.

Explain the nature and scope of channel management
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Channel Management is how a business uses marketing and sales techniques to reach their customer base. Channel management organizes all possible ways to communicate with customers. Organizations must consider their target markets in terms of their preferred methods of communication while trying to reach their goals of gaining and maintaining customers. Regardless of the channels chosen, the messages must always be consistent with the organization’s branding and position.

The Management of the channel refers to the ability of a business to operate all of its sales methods effectively.

The scope of these Channels of Distribution could include direct from manufacturer, retail, wholesale, import, or specialty channel (internet, home shopping,
catalogue, vending machine, etc.). When done properly, effective channel management allows a business to deliver products successfully and a manner of its choosing to customers thus strengthening the relationship between the business and its customers.

Types of communication channels include but are not limited to: social media, print advertising, corporate website, online advertising, telemarketing, email marketing, webcasts, tradeshows, direct mail promotions, white papers, and face-to-face events, on-line video streams, mail office try-on centres.

Explain the nature of channels of distribution
--TERM_DEFINITION--
A channel of distribution is the road that a product or service takes from production to end user. Products and services may use direct or indirect distribution channels to arrive to a customer. Direct distribution is when the producer sells the product to the end user. Indirect distribution involves one or more intermediaries who aid in moving the product from producer to end user. Factors including whether it is a consumer or industrial product affect what channel of distribution is selected.

Explain the nature of channel strategies
--TERM_DEFINITION--
A channel strategy is a vendor's plan for moving a product or a service through the chain of commerce to the end customer. Channels of
distribution can be short (manufacturer to customer) or long (going through intermediaries).
Other possible channel options include: importers, agents, wholesalers, distributors, warehousers, brokers, sales force, e-commerce (website,
social media), retail outlets, vending machines, value-added resellers (Amazon, shopping channel)
The choice of channel will depend on:
- Time to market – for example perishable products need quick delivery
- The costs of each option vs the benefits
- Reach – where the customer expects to buy the product
- Skill – complex products need the skill and expertise of a knowledgeable sales staff
- Competition – mirroring the channels the competition uses may be the best alternative
- Control – ensure product integrity and level of customer service
- Cost of up front investment – whether there are funds to establish your own distribution network
- Brand Image – e.g., Coach sells almost exclusively through its own stores

Explain the nature of marketing research
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Marketing research is a process that involves identifying a problem, gathering and analyzing data, developing solutions, implementing actions and monitoring results. Marketing research is used to understand customer behavior, product uses, learn about competitors, and understand brand awareness.

Explain the concept of market and market identification
--TERM_DEFINITION--
The market is the group of customers a company is most likely to try to sell to. The total market would be all of the potential customers the
company could reach. This total market would be divided into several smaller groups (market segmentation) based on demographic factors
like income, occupation, age, etc. and psychographic factors like attitudes, pet ownership, and lifestyles and geographic factors such as
where the customer’s homes are. The company would then study each segment to determine which group or groups they would like to focus
their efforts on selling to (target market). These decisions will be based on how easy it will be to reach or satisfy certain customers or how
easy it will be to make sales to them.

Explain the nature and scope of the pricing function
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Pricing involves placing a monetary value on a product or service based on tangible things like adequately covering costs, and intangible
things such as company image and the product’s or service’s perceived value. The function of pricing involves the strategies used to set
prices of products, pricing computations such as discounts and markups, and the overall relationship between pricing and the company’s
profitability. The pricing function looks at costs, competition, and how much customers are willing to pay for a good or service.
Participants should be able to identify and explain factors affecting pricing in this situation. The participant’s answer may include (but is not
limited to):
• Cover overhead costs (building costs like rent and utilities, advertising, office expenses and employee costs) Must cover costs, be
competitive, and offer a profit

--ROW--
Explain factors affecting pricing decisions
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Factors affecting a company’s pricing decisions include any or all of the following:
Price-quality relationship: Customers use price as an indicator of quality. When quality does not change customers will not expect a
pricing change.

Explicability: The company should be able to justify the price it is charging, especially if it is on the higher side. An increased price
may alienate customers who were attracted to the low cost.

Competition: A company should be able to anticipate reactions of competitors to its pricing policies and moves. Competitors can negate the advantages that a company might be hoping to make with its pricing policies. A company reduces its price to gain market share. Every company should research what its competitors are charging and have their prices strategically placed the market place.

The costs must be recovered.
The profit must adequately exceed costs.
Market Demand will determine how much can be charged. Both higher demand and lower supply will result in a higher price.

Your business strategy and image will affect your price. The more elite or rare your product is, the higher the price.

Product Uniqueness and Improved Value can also substantiate a higher price.

Loyalty may affect price. Some companies will lower prices to loyal members to keep their business, while others may raise prices knowing that their customers will buy regardless of the price.

--ROW--
Explain the concept of product mix
--TERM_DEFINITION--
The product mix includes all the product lines a company sells. A product line is a group of products sold that have some kind of similarity.

Additions or modifications to a company’s product mix require research and development to ensure the proposed changes appeal to existing
or prospective market segments.
There are 4 dimensions to a company’s product mix:
Width (the number of product lines sold);
Length (the total number of products in the product mix);
Depth (the total number of variations of a product like size, flavor, colour, or other distinguishing characteristic); and,
Consistency (how closely related product lines are to each other in terms of how they are produced and distributed).

Small companies typically start out with a product mix limited in width, length, and depth, but high in consistency. Over time, the company
may want to he company may want to differentiate products or acquire new ones to enter new markets. A company can also sell the existing
products to new markets by coming up with new uses for their product.

External standards may include:
- Being professional, courteous and treating customers with respect
- Showing empathy and ensuring customers feel understood

Explain the role of customer service in positioning/image
--TERM_DEFINITION--
Positioning is the process marketers use to determine how to best communicate their products’ attributes to their target customers based on
customer needs, competitive pressures, available communications channels and carefully crafted key messages. Positioning is finding a
niche, or competitive advantage for a company or product in the market place. One bad experience can undo all the marketing dollars spent
on an image, making customer service a key component in building a strong brand.
Customer service personnel are the first, and maybe only, contact with the company so it is essential for these employees to convey the brand
image and ensure that the customer’s experience is stellar. They can:
- Present an attitude of valuing the customer and offering a consistently helpful, can-do service experience
- Be consistently friendly and helpful in every means of communication (phone and online)
- Build/pursue a professional personal and/or emotional connection to build loyalty
- Be extremely well-informed about all aspects of the company and its products and services
Empower these personnel to ask for feedback, offer small thank you/incentive freebees, and, meet with them and listen to the information they
are getting from customers in order to offer more of what is desired.

Identify company's unique selling proposition
--TERM_DEFINITION--
In general terms, the Unique Selling Position is described as:
- The key to effective selling in this situation is what advertising and marketing professionals call a "unique selling proposition" (USP).
- Unless you can pinpoint what makes your business unique in a world of homogeneous competitors, you cannot target your sales efforts
successfully. Pinpointing your USP requires some hard soul-searching and creativity.
- One way to start is to analyze how other companies use their USPs to their advantage. This requires careful analysis of other companies'
ads and marketing messages. If you analyze what they say they sell, not just their product or service characteristics, you can learn a great
deal about how companies distinguish themselves from competitors.

review/referral channels, or text messages.
- Marketers have long used "word of mouth" (WOM) promotion campaigns. The idea is to get people to pass information about a product to other people. The idea in these kinds of WOM campaigns is to reach segments of consumers who distrust paid advertising by creating
the illusion that the message comes from someone who is like the message recipient.
- Social networking has enabled marketers to make practical use of “viral marketing,” “buzz marketing,” “guerilla marketing,” and other
forms of "word of mouth" marketing that rely on social networking. The general idea of viral marketing is to "let the behaviours of the
target community carry the message."
